# ZOOTOPIA : FPGA Arcade Game

# Introduction
The idea for our 1D project came from our collective fondness of games from the time gone by and love for all the different life-forms we share our world with i.e. animals.<br><br>

Our game Zootopia takes on the task of putting a classic twist on a single-player game that everyone is familiar with, Hangman. The premise of Zootopia rests on being a fun, interactive word-game where the player makes guesses at the letters of the word with a limited number of lives (3 to be exact). While this describes the basic idea of the game, the inclusion of several levels, the added atmosphere created by the carefully color-curated LEDs, the rustic arcade theme given off by the hardware design etc. truly makes it a memorable experience.
